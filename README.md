# Kali MCP WebUI

A privacy-preserving, fully localized agentic penetration testing platform. Kali MCP WebUI bridges the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and native cybersecurity toolchains by utilizing the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Unlike cloud-dependent conversational hacking tools, this platform ensures that your proprietary network layouts, vulnerability telemetry, and zero-day discoveries never leave your perimeter by orchestrating everything through a local LLM instance (like Ollama).

## Core Capabilities

*   **Fully Localized Execution**: Runs entirely on your local machine or trusted VM. Optional API key auth is supported for authenticated Ollama-compatible endpoints, but credentials stay local and are not written into run logs.
*   **Agentic Tool Execution**: The LLM autonomously triggers local Kali Linux utilities (e.g., `nmap`, `gobuster`, `ping`) via the MCP server and integrates the raw output directly into its reasoning loop.
*   **Synchronous Subprocess Blocking**: Prevents LLM hallucinations by forcing the agent to wait for long-running processes to complete in the foreground.
*   **Comprehensive Audit Trails**: Generates structured JSON tool execution logs and beautiful, human-readable Markdown transcripts for every session.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Annotations**: Analysts can actively insert timestamped notes and tag areas of interest mid-execution to guide the agent or flag data for later review.
*   **Live Span Analysis**: Seamlessly analyze the last *N* minutes of a live engagement using a one-shot LLM inference to generate rapid pivoting strategies or identify execution bottlenecks in real-time.
*   **Post-Mortem Session Analysis**: Feed an entire past session transcript (along with your manual annotations) back into the LLM to auto-generate narrative success summaries, highlight critical vulnerabilities, and pinpoint areas for methodological optimization.
*   **Session Archiving**: Download entire session directories—including the generated artifacts, tool schemas, and transcription—as self-contained ZIP archives.
*   **User Keylogger**: Optional browser and system-wide keystroke logging for interaction pattern analysis. Captures which applications/windows were active during each keystroke.

## Architecture

*   **Frontend**: A responsive Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS WebUI with a persistent chat console, real-time token tracking, dynamic tool execution indicators, and a session browser.
*   **Middleware Orchestrator**: A Python Flask server (`app.py`) that handles RESTful routing and streams real-time interaction events to the frontend via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
*   **MCP Client Engine**: `mcp_client.py` acts as the intelligent broker, managing the context window, parsing LLM payloads, and mapping them to standard I/O subprocess executions.
*   **LLM Backend**: Powered by the Python `ollama` library, driving conversational endpoints against a local or proxied Ollama-compatible model endpoint (e.g., `llama3`).
*   **MCP Server (Kali)**: A localized script (`mcp_kali.py`) that securely wraps standard Kali utilities and exposes them as callable functions to the Client Engine.

## Requirements

*   **OS**: Kali Linux (recommended) or any Debian-based distribution with standard security tools installed.
*   **Python**: 3.10+
*   **LLM Provider**: [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) or another Ollama-compatible endpoint. If your endpoint is behind a proxy such as LiteLLM and requires bearer auth, provide the API key in the UI.
*   **Model**: A capable tool-calling model pulled into Ollama (e.g., `ollama run llama3` or `llama3.1`).
*   **Python Dependencies**:
    *   `Flask`
    *   `requests`
    *   `mcp` (Official Model Context Protocol SDK)
    *   `ollama`
    *   `pynput` (for system keylogger)

*   **System Keylogger Prerequisites (Linux)**:
    *   `xdotool` - Required for active window detection
    *   `x11-utils` - Provides `xprop` for application name detection
    *   `python3-psutil` - Required for process information
    
    Install these packages with:
    ```bash
    sudo ./install_prerequisites.sh
    ```
    Or manually:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install xdotool x11-utils python3-psutil
    ```

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/raistlinJ/kali-mcp-webui.git
    cd kali-mcp-webui
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Preferred local launcher:
    ```bash
    ./start_local.sh
    ```
    This bootstraps `uv` if needed and runs the WebUI with the required Python dependencies.

    Manual installation alternative:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Ensure Ollama is Running**
    *   Start the Ollama service on your machine, or point the UI at an authenticated Ollama-compatible proxy.
    *   Ensure you have downloaded your preferred model: `ollama pull llama3`

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Web Server**
    From the project root directory, run:
    ```bash
    ./start_local.sh
    ```
    Manual alternative:
    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```
    *(By default, the Flask server will launch on `http://localhost:5055`.)*

2.  **Access the Dashboard**
    Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5055`.

3.  **Configure and Start the Engine**
    *   Navigate to the **Configuration** tab in the WebUI.
    *   If needed, enter an optional **API Key** for authenticated endpoints.
    *   Click **Fetch Models** to populate the dropdown with your available models.
    *   Select your model (e.g., `llama3`).
    *   Allocate your desired Context Window (Default: 8K).
    *   Click **Start Service**. The dot indicator should turn green.

4.  **Begin Testing**
    *   Switch to the **Live Chat** tab.
    *   Set the **Scope** and **Urgency** sliders above the prompt box to control how broadly and how aggressively the agent should approach the current request.
    *   Issue a natural language command (e.g., *"Run a fast nmap scan against scanme.nmap.org"*).
    *   Watch as the agent dynamically executes the tool in the foreground, streams the output, and returns an analysis!

### Scope Control

The **Scope** slider sits directly above the Live Chat prompt box and changes the per-turn context guidance sent to the model before your prompt is processed.

It does **not** change the configured context window size. Instead, it changes the **instructional scope** for that specific prompt: whether the agent should cast a wide net and look broadly for anything useful, or stay tightly focused on the most promising path.

Each setting adds different scope guidance to the turn context:

*   **Broad**: Instructs the model to maximize coverage across the reachable target surface, look for any meaningful weakness or misconfiguration, and favor breadth and triage over deep pursuit of one path. Best fit for blue-team style review or general exposure discovery.
*   **Medium-Broad**: Instructs the model to cover the strongest adjacent attack surfaces while still prioritizing the best leads. Useful when you want broad situational awareness without fully exhaustive exploration.
*   **Medium**: Instructs the model to balance surface coverage with targeted follow-through. This is the default setting and is meant for general-purpose engagements.
*   **Medium-Narrow**: Instructs the model to stay focused on the strongest-looking paths and minimize side exploration unless needed to validate a hypothesis or unblock the current line of work.
*   **Narrow**: Instructs the model to pursue the most promising route to at least one viable foothold or concrete way in, while avoiding broad enumeration unless it directly supports that goal. Best fit for tightly targeted red-team style probing.

Scope is applied **per prompt**, so you can widen or narrow the agent's behavior as the engagement evolves.

### Urgency Control

The **Urgency** slider sits next to **Scope** above the Live Chat prompt box and changes the per-turn execution tempo guidance sent to the model.

It is meant to influence how aggressively the agent operates: scan timing, batching, parallelism, and how much time it should spend validating and going deep before returning progress.

Each setting adds different urgency guidance to the turn context:

*   **Stealthy**: Biases the agent toward quieter, lower-noise commands, slower timing, smaller batches, and deeper verification before escalating.
*   **Methodical**: Keeps the agent cautious and thorough, with modest concurrency and a preference for explainable, validated progress over speed.
*   **Balanced**: Uses a middle-ground tempo and trades off stealth, depth, and speed pragmatically. This is the default setting.
*   **Fast**: Pushes the agent toward quicker iteration, more assertive timing, and higher parallelism when appropriate.
*   **Speed**: Optimizes for rapid answers using aggressive but still policy-compliant timing and concurrency, accepting more noise and less depth when useful.

Urgency is also applied **per prompt**, so you can slow the agent down for quiet enumeration and then turn it up when you want faster feedback.

## User Keylogger Feature

The WebUI includes an optional keylogger feature that captures all user keystrokes for interaction pattern analysis.

### Features

- **Browser Keylogger**: Captures all keystrokes within the WebUI
- **System Keylogger**: Captures system-wide keystrokes (requires `xdotool` on Linux)
- **Window Tracking**: Records which application/window was active for each keystroke
- **Privacy Protection**: Sensitive fields (passwords, API keys) are automatically excluded
- **Session Correlation**: Keystrokes are linked to the current session for analysis
- **Archive Support**: Captured keystrokes are written into `runs/<run_id>/keystrokes/` and included in session downloads

### Enabling Keylogging

1. Navigate to the **Configuration** tab
2. Open the **Logging** subtab
3. Check **Enable Keylogging**
4. Start a session

### Linux Prerequisites

For full system keylogger functionality on Linux, you need `xdotool` installed:

```bash
sudo ./install_prerequisites.sh
```

This script will:
- Detect your distribution (Kali 2025.x/2026.x, Debian, Ubuntu)
- Install `xdotool`, `x11-utils`, and `python3-psutil`
- Verify the installation

Without `xdotool`, the system keylogger will still capture keystrokes but won't be able to detect which application/window was active.

### Docker Note

When the WebUI is running inside Docker, the system-wide keylogger is automatically disabled. Browser keystroke logging still works, but `system_log.jsonl` will not be produced from containerized runs.

### Data Storage

Keystrokes are stored in `runs/<run_id>/keystrokes/`:
- `browser_log.jsonl` - Browser keystrokes with URL and page context
- `system_log.jsonl` - System keystrokes with application and window title

### Privacy Notes

- Password fields and API key fields are automatically excluded
- Sensitive field names (password, api_key, secret, token, etc.) are detected by class/id/name
- Only metadata about sensitive field interaction is logged (not the actual keystrokes)

## Using the Observation & Analysis Engine

### Live Span Analysis
If you get stuck during an engagement:
1. Click the **Annotate (pencil icon)** button next to the chat prompt.
2. Change the action dropdown to **🪄 Analyze Logs**.
3. Select a timeframe (e.g., **"Last 5 Minutes"**).
4. Click **Run Analysis**. The LLM will parse only that specific window of execution and inject tactical suggestions directly into your active chat feed.

### Post-Mortem Analysis
To review completed work:
1. Ensure the backend Service is active in the Configuration tab.
2. Navigate to the **Past Sessions** tab and select a previous run.
3. Click the **🪄 Analyze Session** button in the top right.
4. An **Analysis** tab will render an AI-generated review of the session, highlighting unused tools and efficiency optimizations.
